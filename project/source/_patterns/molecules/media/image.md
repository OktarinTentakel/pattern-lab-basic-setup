This pattern combines a content image with additional info such as a media caption for using images in a manner fit
for use in layouts such as text/media content organisms, where an optional caption or additional elements concerning
the image might be necessary.

Keep in mind, that this element, in contrast to the atom always optionally allows things like captions and
is not an inline block, but a block element supposed to be used in block based layouts.

So, if an inline image is needed or a image should definitely only be the image itself, the atom might be the better
choice. This pattern is geared towards annotated usages in organism layouts.
